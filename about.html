        Hello there!
    </h2>
    <li>
        My name is Victor Mak and my desire for knowledge never ends. With my background in Industrial Design, I honed my skills in sketching, making physical prototypes and introducing my polished designs to my class. However, I wanted to learn more than the production side of what Industrial Design had offered me. Once I graduated, I wanted to extend my skills and discovered the area of User Experience Design. Currently, I enjoy researching and solving the right problems for users that in turn can help produce and deliver a better experience.
        When I'm not designing, I love to keep up to date with the latest and greatest tech products. I'm always excited to see what new piece of tech is revealed and how it can further improve our lives. With my knowledge in tech, my friends would reach out to me for help and it always made me happy to find out I can assist them. Ever need a recommendation for a certain product? I would be more than happy to help you out.
        With my background in Industrial Design and understanding of User Experience Design, I hope to create a unique digital and physical user experience package that would address people in need.
